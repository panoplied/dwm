dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Custom build patched via git merge with:
    pango               ttf support for status bar
    centeredmaster      layout with master window in center, Mod + U
    removeborder        doesn't show border when only one window shown
    pertag              keeps layout, mwfact, barpos and nmaster per tag
    resizecorners       resizing window by any corner
    swallow             when app launched from terminal it is contained within terminal window


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
